# Pavement_crack_detect
Pavement crack detection is a critical task in road infrastructure management to ensure safety and longevity and is critical to enable autonomous driving. Traditionally, this process has been conducted manually, making it time-consuming and error-prone. In this work, semantic segmentation was employed to automate crack detection, utilizing U-Net and SegNet on the Crack500 dataset.

Crack500 dataset [1]: The RGB image (Input) and Segmented Image (Desired Output) respectively.
